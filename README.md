## INTRODUCTION

Hector is a search engine that helps you find places around you.


## Launch Hector

To access Hector, go to https://hector-tristan-tr.herokuapp.com

## How to use 

Fill the form with an address, a type of places you are looking for, and a distance between 200m and 1km. Hector will display a list of places ! 

## Built with

Here are some modules I used to build the program, all listed in the requirements.txt file.

 * __Django__ (https://www.djangoproject.com/)
 * __Requests__ (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

 For this program, I also make requests from a public API:
 * __Google Places API__ (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)

I also used a Boostrap for the front.
